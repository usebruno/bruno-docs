# Whitelisting Modules

Not all built-in modules are accessible in scripts out of the box in Bruno for security reasons. You can manually enable/whitelist these modules by modifying your `bruno.json`.

**Example:**

To enable the `child_process` module, you can put the following in your `bruno.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "moduleWhitelist": ["child_process"],
    "filesystemAccess": {
      "allow": true
    }
  }
}
```

Note that `filesystemAccess` is required for `child_process` to work as expected. This may be required for other built-in modules as well
