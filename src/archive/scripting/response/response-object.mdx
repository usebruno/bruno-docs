# Response Object

The `res` object that is available inside the [vars](../vars), [assertions](/testing/assertions), [scripting](../getting-started) and [testing](/testing/introduction)
contexts can be used to extract values from the response body, headers and status.

*Note that the `res` object is only available in the context of a request.*

You can also access it with [response queries](./response-query).

## Object Structure

The `res` object has the following properties:

- `body`: Represents the response body containing data returned to the client.
- `headers`: Contains key-value pairs representing HTTP headers associated with the response.
- `status`: Represents the HTTP status code indicating the outcome of the request.

## Property Descriptions

### `body`

The `body` property of the `res` object contains the response data sent to the client. It can be a string, an object, or a stream, depending on the application's needs.

### `headers`

The `headers` property contains HTTP headers associated with the response. These headers provide metadata about the response, such as content type, encoding, and caching directives.

### `status`

The `status` property represents the HTTP status code of the response. It indicates the outcome of the request, such as success, redirection, client error, or server error.

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Example response object
const res = {
  body: '{"message": "Hello, world!"}',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
  },
  status: 200,
};

// Accessing response properties
console.log(res.body); // Output: '{"message": "Hello, world!"}'
console.log(res.headers['Content-Type']); // Output: 'application/json'
console.log(res.status); // Output: 200
```
