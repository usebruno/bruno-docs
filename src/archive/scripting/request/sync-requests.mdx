# Sync requests

You can make synchronous requests in your pre/post scripts. By synchronous, we mean that you can await a request in your scripting code.

Below is an inbuilt example of using `axios` library to

```js
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.get('https://api.github.com/users/usebruno');

bru.setVar('avatarUrl', response.data.avatar_url);
```
