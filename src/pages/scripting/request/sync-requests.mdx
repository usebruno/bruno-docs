# Sync requests

You can make synchronous requests in your pre/post scripts. By synchronous, we mean that you can await a request in your scripting code.

Below is an inbuilt example of using `axios` library to
```js
const axios = require("axios");

const response = await axios.get("https://api.github.com/users/usebruno");

bru.setVar("avatarUrl", response.data.avatar_url);
```
