# Language Design

A Bru file is made up of blocks.
There are three kinds of blocks

- Dictionary block
- Text block
- Array block

### Dictionary block

A dictionary block contains a set of key value pairs. <br />

```bash
get {
  url: https://api.textlocal.in/send
}

headers {
  content-type: application/json
  Authorization: Bearer 123
  ~transaction-id: {{transactionId}}
}
```

Any key in the dictionary block can be prefixed with `~` to indicate that it is disabled.

### Text block

A text block is a set of lines

```bash
body {
  {
    "hello": "world"
  }
}

tests {
  expect(res.status).to.equal(200);
}
```

### Array block

An array block is a list of strings

```bash
vars:secret [
  access_key,
  access_secret,
  ~transactionId
]
```

Any key in the array block can be prefixed with `~` to indicate that it is disabled.
