# Bruno CLI

With Bruno CLI, you can run your API collections with ease using simple command line commands.

This makes it easier to test your APIs in different environments, automate your testing process, and integrate your API tests with your continuous integration and deployment workflows.

## Installation
To install the Bruno CLI, use the node package manager of your choice, such as NPM:
```bash copy
npm install -g @usebruno/cli
```

## Getting Started

Navigate to the directory where your API collection resides, and run the following command:

```bash copy
bru run
```

This will run all the requests in your collection. If you want to run a single request, specify its filename:

```bash copy
bru run request.bru
```

## Running Requests in a Folder
To run all the requests within a folder, use:

```bash copy
bru run folder
```

## Using Environments
If you need to use a specific environment, you can pass it with the --env option:

```bash copy
bru run folder --env Local
```

## Passing Environment Variables

> Variables marked as secrets in Bruno app are not accessible via the CLI. Pass them directly as command-line arguments.

```bash copy
bru run folder --env Local --env-var JWT_TOKEN=1234
```

## Running a Collection with a CSV File
If you need to run a collection using data from a CSV file, specify the path to the file with the `--csv-file-path` option:

```bash copy
bru run folder --csv-file-path /path/to/csv/file.csv
```

## Running a Collection with a JSON File
To run a collection using data from a JSON file, provide the file path using the `--json-file-path` option:

```bash copy
bru run folder --json-file-path /path/to/json/file.json
```
> This feature requires Bruno CLI version 1.35.0 or higher.


## Outputting Results
To save the results of your API tests to a file, use the --output option:

```bash copy
bru run folder --output results.json
```

## Skipping Specific Headers in the Report

If you want to exclude certain headers from the report, use the `--reporter-skip-headers` option. You can list multiple headers to skip, separated by spaces.

```bash
bru run --reporter-html results.html --reporter-skip-headers "Authorization" "Content-Type" "Date"
```

## Skip All Headers in the Report

To exclude all headers from the report, use the `--reporter-skip-all-headers` option. This will remove all headers from the output report, ensuring a cleaner result.

```bash copy
bru run --reporter-html results.html --reporter-skip-all-headers
```

## Using Client Certificates for API Requests

If your API requests require client certificates for authentication, you can specify using the `--client-cert-config` option. The configuration should be provided in a JSON file. Here's an example of how to use this option:

```bash copy
bru run folder --client-cert-config /path/to/client-cert-config.json
```

The client-cert-config.json file should contain the following fields:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "certs": [
    {
      "domain": "usebruno.com",
      "type": "cert",
      "certFilePath": "certs/server_1.crt",
      "keyFilePath": "private/server_1.key",
      "passphrase": "Iu$eBrun0_#Secure!"
    },
    {
      "domain": "the-example.com",
      "type": "pfx",
      "pfxFilePath": "pfx/server_3.pfx",
      "passphrase": "L!ghT_Y@g@mi_2024!"
    }
  ]
}
```
## Adding Delay
If you need to add a delay between requests during the execution of your API collection, you can use the `--delay` option.

Example:
```bash copy
bru run . --delay 1000
```
## Generating Reports

Bruno CLI provides built-in support for generating reports in three formats: **JSON**, **JUnit**, and **HTML**. These reports help with analyzing test results and integrating with various CI/CD tools.

You can generate any combination of these reports and even run them simultaneously.

### JSON Report

To generate a report in JSON format, use the `--reporter-json` option:

```bash copy
bru run request.bru --reporter-json results.json
```

This will output the test results in a results.json file, which can be useful for further processing or programmatic analysis.

### JUnit Report

To generate a report in JUnit format, use the --reporter-junit option:

```bash copy
bru run request.bru --reporter-junit results.xml
```

The results.xml file will be in a format compatible with JUnit, making it ideal for integration with CI/CD pipelines that rely on JUnit reporting.


### HTML Report

To generate a human-readable HTML report, use the --reporter-html option:

```bash copy
bru run request.bru --reporter-html results.html
```

This will create an results.html file that provides a visual representation of the test outcomes, ideal for quick reviews.

### Running Multiple Reporters Simultaneously

You can generate multiple reports at once by specifying more than one reporter option. For example, to generate JSON, JUnit, and HTML reports simultaneously, run:

```bash copy
bru run request.bru --reporter-json results.json --reporter-junit results.xml --reporter-html results.html
```

This command will create three files: results.json, results.xml, and results.html, allowing you to analyze the results in different formats as needed.
