# Running a Collection 

Bruno CLI allows you to run your API collections with ease, either by directly executing requests or using external data sources.

This guide explains how to run entire collections, specific folders, and how to use data sources like CSV and JSON files to drive your API tests.

## Basic Collection Execution

To run an entire collection, navigate to your collection directory and use the `run` command:

```bash copy
bru run
```

## Running a Folder within a Collection

You can run all the requests within a specific folder by specifying the folder name:

```bash copy
bru run <folder-name>
```

For example, to run all requests in the **users** folder:

```bash copy
bru run users
```

## Running a Collection with a CSV File

<Callout type="info">
  This feature requires [Bruno CLI <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@usebruno/cli) version 1.35.0 or higher.
</Callout>

If you need to run a collection using data from a CSV file, specify the path to the file with the `--csv-file-path` option:

```bash copy
bru run --csv-file-path /path/to/csv/file.csv
```

This will execute the collection once for each row in the CSV file, with each row's data available as variables in your requests.

## Running a Collection with a JSON File

To run a collection using data from a JSON file, provide the file path using the `--json-file-path` option:

```bash copy
bru run --json-file-path /path/to/json/file.json
```
## Running a Collection Multiple Times

You can run a collection multiple times in a single command using the `--iteration-count` flag:

```bash copy
bru run --iteration-count=2
```

This will execute the collection twice. This is useful for load testing or when you need to repeat the same set of requests multiple times.

## Running a Collection with Environments

You can run a collection using environment variables from a `.bru` file. This allows you to attach environments via the CLI from anywhere in the filesystem.

### Using Environment Files

To run a collection with an environment file, use the `--env-file` option:

```bash copy
bru run --env-file /path/to/environment.bru
```

You can specify either a relative or absolute path to the environment file:

```bash copy
# Using relative path
bru run --env-file ./environments/local.bru

# Using absolute path
bru run --env-file /Users/username/projects/api-testing/environments/prod.bru
```

<Callout type="info">
  The environment file should be in Bruno's `.bru` format. Make sure the file contains valid environment variables and their values.
</Callout>

### Using Environments Names

If you need to use a specific environment, you can pass it with the `--env` option:

```bash copy
bru run --env Local
```

#### Passing Environment Variables

<Callout type="info">
Variables marked as secrets in Bruno app are not accessible via the CLI. Pass them directly as command-line arguments.
</Callout>

```bash copy
bru run --env Local --env-var JWT_TOKEN=1234
```

## Multiple Environment Variables

You can override multiple environment variables by using additional `--env-var` flags:

```bash copy
bru run --env Local --env-var JWT_TOKEN=1234 --env-var API_KEY=abcd1234 
```

Each `--env-var` flag adds or overrides a single environment variable, and you can chain as many as needed.

## Filtering Requests with Tags

Bruno CLI supports filtering requests by tags, allowing you to run only specific subsets of your collection based on tag criteria.

<Callout type="info">
  This feature requires [Bruno CLI <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@usebruno/cli) version 2.8.0 or higher.
</Callout>

### Include Tags

Run only requests that have at least one matching tag.

```bash copy
bru run --tags=smoke,sanity
```

#### Exclude Tags

Skip requests that have ANY of the specified tags:

```bash copy
bru run --exclude-tags=skip,draft
```

#### Combined Filtering

You can combine include and exclude filters:

```bash copy
bru run --tags=smoke,sanity --exclude-tags=skip,draft
```

### Progress Display

To see real-time progress during collection execution, use the `--show-progress` flag:

```bash copy
bru run --show-progress
```

This displays a formatted table showing:
- Request status (running, completed, failed)
- Response times
- Test results
- Overall progress
