# Posting an XML body

If you are posting against XML APIs it might be easier for you to get the XML directly from an XML file instead of posting its content into the _Form URL Encoded_ fields.

To enable file system access with bruno, you have to enable a setting within the collections `bruno.json` file:

```json copy filename="bruno.json"
{
  "version": "1",
  "name": "my-collection",
  "type": "collection",
  "scripts": {
    "filesystemAccess": {
      "allow": true
    }
  }
}
```

Besides that, just use a similar script like this one to pull data from your XML file that resides right next to your _.bru_ file:

```js copy
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

const attachmentFilename = "some.xml";
const attachmentPath = path.join(bru.cwd(), attachmentFilename);
const attachment = fs.readFileSync(attachmentPath);

req.setBody({"MyServiceXmlrequest": attachment.toString()});
```
