# Vars

Vars allow you to set variables before request, and after you receive the response.

Vars are scoped within the request and cannot be accessed outside of it.

> Note: Prior to v1.20.0, request vars were accessible at the collection scope, but this is no longer the case.

In the _Pre Request Variables_ section, you can write any Strings, Numbers or any valid JavaScript literal.

In the _Post Response Variables_ section, you can write any valid JavaScript expression. The res object is available, allowing you to declaratively parse the [response](./javascript-reference#response) and set variables, instead of writing scripts to do the same.

For parsing the response, you can checkout the [response query](./response/response-query) that allows you to easily query your response.
