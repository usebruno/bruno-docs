# External Libraries

Bruno allows you to load any npm module for use in your scripting workflows. 

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

1. Node.js installed on your system.
2. Bruno installed.

## Project Structure

The folder structure for this example will look as follows:

 <FileTree>
      <FileTree.Folder name="bruno-collection" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="api-testing" />
        <FileTree.File name="openspec.yaml" />
        <FileTree.File name=".spectral.yml" />
        <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="node_modules">
          <FileTree.File name="spectral-cli" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree>
 
## Configuration
You need to initialize `package.json` file inside your collection.

Navigate to your Bruno collection directory.
 ```bash
 cd path/to/your/bruno-collection
 ```

Initialize `package.json` file inside your collection.
```bash
npm init -y
```


Now you can install any npm package or module to use in your collection.

## Spectral Integration

In this example we're using [Spectral CLI](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral?tab=readme-ov-file) as a npm package which help you to valide OpenAPI YAML or JSON document with the built-in ruleset. 

You need to have OpenAPI JSON or YAML file to work with spectral or you can download from [here](https://github.com/ganesh-bruno/spectral-example) as example.

### Spectral CLI Setup
You can install `spectral-cli` by running following command:
```bash
npm install @stoplight/spectral-cli
```


Run this command into your terminal to initialize `.spectral.yml` file which is predefined ruleset.

```js copy
echo 'extends: ["spectral:oas", "spectral:asyncapi", "spectral:arazzo"]' > .spectral.yaml
```

Validate your **openapi.yaml** file from Bruno collection by running follwoing CLI command:
```js copy
spectral lint openspec.yaml --r .spectral.yaml 
```

## Output Overview

After following above process the expected results should be look as follows:
