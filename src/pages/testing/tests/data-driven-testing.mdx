# Iterate Using Data Files

The **Collection Runner** feature allows you to iterate over data files, making it easy to automate and manage data-driven requests. Bruno supports both CSV and JSON files for running requests, so you can efficiently run tests or process multiple data inputs.

# Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore the Collection Runner feature, which enables you to run collections using custom data for each iteration.

## Steps to Get Started

1. **Open the Bruno app.**
2. **Create a collection** called `runner-example`
3. **Create a POST request** and name it `runner-request`
4. **Use the URL**: `https://reqres.in/api/users`
5. **Select the JSON format for the request body** and add the following data:

```bash
{
    "name": "morpheus",
    "job": "leader"
}
```

> Selecting the JSON option for the request body and adding JSON data is optional.

## Using the Collection Runner

We will create a sample data file `csv-example.csv` that includes input fields such as `name` and `job` to be used in data-driven testing. You need to create a CSV or JSON file according to the specific requirements of the API you're working with.

Since the API in this case expects two data inputs `name` and `job` the file should contain these fields. Here's an example of how to structure your data:

**1. CSV Format Example**  
A sample CSV file might look like this:

```bash copy
name, job
John Doe, Software Engineer
Jane Smith, Product Manager
Mark Lee, Data Scientist
```

**2. JSON Format Example**  
A sample JSON file might look like this:

```bash copy
[
  { "name": "John Doe", "job": "Software Engineer" },
  { "name": "Jane Smith", "job": "Product Manager" },
  { "name": "Mark Lee", "job": "Data Scientist" }
]
```

Now you're ready to use the Collection Runner. You can access it in two ways:

### Using the Bruno App

1. Click on the runner icon in the right-hand navbar.
2. Check the **Run with Parameters** option.
3. Select the file type: CSV or JSON.
4. Click **Run Collection**.

Once the execution is complete, you can review the results for each individual request and check their statuses.

#### How to Use Variables from CSV/JSON Files

When you upload a CSV or JSON file, the variables within the file can be accessed using the `{{var}}` syntax.
You can access these variables dynamically in your requests and use them within Bruno.

**Example**:

##### Accessing Variables in Request Body

```json showLineNumbers filename="request-body"
{
  "name": "{{name}}",
  "email": "{{email}}"
}
```

In this example, `{{name}}` and `{{email}}` will be replaced by the actual values from the uploaded JSON file.

```json showLineNumbers filename="request-with-interpolated-values"
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

##### Accessing Variables in Scripts

You can also access these variables directly in your pre-request or post-response scripts using `bru.getVar()`.

```js
console.log(bru.getVar('name')); // Outputs: John Doe
console.log(bru.getVar('email')); // Outputs: john.doe@example.com
```

When you run the request, youâ€™ll see the output of these variables in the console.

### Using the Bruno CLI

1. Navigate to the root directory of your Bruno collection.
2. Run the following command:

```bash copy
   bru run --reporter-html results.html --csv-file-path /path/to/csv/file.csv
```

or

```bash copy
   bru run --output results.html --format html --csv-file-path /path/to/csv/file.csv
```

<Video src="/assets/demo-csv-runner-cli.mp4" />

It will create a `results.html` file in your Bruno collection's root directory. You can view this file in your browser.

### Command Overview

1. `--reporter-html results.html`: Generates a human-readable HTML report.
2. `--csv-file-path /path/to/csv/file.csv`: Specifies the path to the CSV file you want to use.
