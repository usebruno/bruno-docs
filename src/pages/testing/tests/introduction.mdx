# Testing

<Callout emoji="">
  Bruno uses the [Chai library <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://www.chaijs.com/), so you can follow the
  same syntax for writing assertions in your tests.
</Callout>

Bruno supports writing automation test scripts in JavaScript for your API requests to assert its behaviour.

Some of the benefits include

- Increased efficiency: The tests can be run repeatedly, reducing the time and effort required for manual testing.
- Increased coverage: Automated tests can cover a larger range of scenarios and edge cases compared to manual testing.
- Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD): Automated API tests can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that API changes are thoroughly tested before deployment.
- Easier maintenance: Automated tests can be easily updated as the API evolves, reducing the maintenance burden compared to manual tests.
- Easier regression testing: Automated tests can be easily repeated after changes are made to the API, reducing the time required for regression testing.

**Example:**

```javascript
test("should be able to login", function () {
  expect(res.getStatus()).to.equal(200);
});

test("should return json", function () {
  expect(res.getBody()).to.eql({
    hello: "Bruno",
  });
});
```

### Scripting API

Please see the [Scripting API](../script/javascript-reference) for a comprehensive set of methods that enable you to write custom JavaScript code to automate and test your API requests in Bruno. It allows you to manipulate request variables, modify headers, handle response data, and implement complex logic directly within your test scripts.
