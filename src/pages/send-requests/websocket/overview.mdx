# WebSocket Overview

Bruno now supports WebSocket connections, enabling you to test real-time communication protocols and bidirectional data exchange. This feature allows you to establish WebSocket connections, send messages, and receive responses in real-time.

<Callout type="info">
WebSocket support is available in Bruno 2.13.0.

## What are WebSockets?

WebSockets provide a persistent, full-duplex communication channel between a client and server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests that follow a request-response pattern, WebSockets maintain an open connection that allows both the client and server to send messages at any time.

## WebSocket vs HTTP

| Feature | HTTP | WebSocket |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Connection** | Request-Response | Persistent |
| **Latency** | Higher (connection overhead) | Lower (persistent connection) |
| **Data Flow** | Unidirectional | Bidirectional |
| **Use Case** | Traditional APIs | Real-time applications |
| **Overhead** | Higher per request | Lower per message |
| **Complexity** | Simple | More complex |
