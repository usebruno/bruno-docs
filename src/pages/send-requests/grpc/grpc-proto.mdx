# gRPC Proto Files

Proto files (`.proto`) are the foundation of gRPC services, defining the contract between clients and servers. Bruno supports adding proto files to enhance your gRPC development experience with better IntelliSense, method discovery, and type safety.

## Proto File Options

You have two ways to add Proto files for enhanced IntelliSense and method discovery:

**Option 1: Request Level**

1. Open your gRPC request in Bruno
2. In the gRPC interface, locate the **Using Reflection** section
3. Click on the **Browse for proto file** button or toggle the proto file option
4. Click the file browser to select `.proto` files from your local system

**Option 2: Collection Level**

1. Go to collection level settings
2. Navigate to the **gRPC** tab
3. Click the **Browse for proto files** to select `.proto` files from your local system

![Collection Level Proto File](/screenshots/send-request/grpc/coll-level-proto-file.webp)

Add Proto files at the collection level for reuse across all requests.

Bruno will validate that the selected files are valid proto files.
You can add multiple proto files if your service uses imports or multiple definitions.

## Import Paths

When working with proto files that import other proto files, Bruno now supports specifying import paths to resolve dependencies without requiring absolute paths. This makes it easier to organize your proto files in different directories while maintaining proper imports.

### Adding Import Paths

To configure import paths for your proto files:

1. Go to **Collection Settings**
2. Navigate to the **Protobuf** tab
3. In the **Import Paths** section, click **Add Import Path**
4. Specify the directory path where Bruno should look for imported proto files

### Import Path Types

Bruno supports different types of import paths:

**Relative Paths**
- Use relative paths from your collection root
- Example: `./proto`, `../shared/proto`

**Absolute Paths**
- Use full system paths
- Example: `/Users/username/projects/api/proto`

**Collection Root**
- Use `.` to reference the collection directory itself
- Useful when proto files are in the same directory as your collection

### How Import Paths Work

When Bruno encounters an import statement in a proto file:

```protobuf
import "common/user.proto";
import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";
```

Bruno will search for these files in the following order:
1. The same directory as the importing proto file
2. All specified import paths (in the order they were added)
3. Standard protobuf library paths

### Example Setup

Consider this directory structure:
```
my-api/
├── collection/
│   ├── user_service.proto
│   └── order_service.proto
├── shared/
│   ├── common/
│   │   └── user.proto
│   └── types/
│       └── timestamp.proto
└── external/
    └── google/
        └── protobuf/
            └── timestamp.proto
```

To make this work, you would add these import paths in collection settings:
- `../shared` (for common/user.proto and types/timestamp.proto)
- `../external` (for google/protobuf/timestamp.proto)

### Automatic Import Path Management

Bruno automatically manages import paths when you add proto files at the request level:

1. When you add a proto file to a request, Bruno automatically adds its directory to the collection's import paths
2. This ensures that any imports within that proto file are properly resolved
3. The import paths are shared across all requests in the collection
