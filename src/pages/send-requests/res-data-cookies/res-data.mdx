# Response Data

The API returns data as a response from the server after the request is executed. The response panel in Bruno provides you with an organized view of the API's response, including the body, headers, HTTP status code, raw response code, and more.

### Response Panel

After executing a request, the response panel provides detailed information on the API's response. It shows the response body, headers, status code, and other relevant data. You can also search within the response using the `cmd+f` or `ctrl+f` keyboard shortcut.

### Data Type Selector

Bruno provides a powerful response format selector that allows you to view API responses in different formats, making it easier to inspect and analyze response data. This feature includes both an **Editor** view for viewing formatted code and a **Preview** view for visualizing the response content.


### Headers

The request headers are displayed to show what was sent to the API. This can help in debugging and understanding the context of the request.

### Timeline

The response timeline displays the response headers sent along with the request body, including details such as content-type, date, cache, and connection status.

### Save Response

You can save the response data for future reference in two ways:

#### Save Response as Example

Save the response as an example that appears as a sub-request under your main request. This is useful for documenting different API behaviors, error scenarios, and edge cases.

#### Export Response to File

You can also export the response data to a file, allowing you to store the results in various formats such as HTML.

### Clear Response

If you want to reset or clear the response data, you can easily do so using the clear response option.

### Raw Response

The raw response provides the unprocessed data returned by the server, giving you access to the raw output for advanced inspection.
