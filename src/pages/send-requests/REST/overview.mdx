# Overview

A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a popular architectural style for designing APIs and web services. It enables communication between clients and servers through standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH to transfer data.

REST APIs are stateless, meaning the server does not store any information about the client between requests. This stateless nature makes REST APIs easier to maintain and scale.

### HTTP Methods

| HTTP Method          | Usage                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `GET /users`         | Retrieve a list of users.                  |
| `POST/users`         | Create a new user.                         |
| `PUT /users/{id}`    | Update the information of a specific user. |
| `DELETE /users/{id}` | Delete a user.                             |

### HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. They provide information about the outcome of the request. Here's a table of some common HTTP status codes and their descriptions:

| **Status Code** | **Description** |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| 100             | Informational   |
| 200             | Successful      |
| 300             | Redirection     |
| 400             | Client Error    |
| 500             | Server Error    |

These status codes help communicate the outcome or failure of an HTTP request to the client.
