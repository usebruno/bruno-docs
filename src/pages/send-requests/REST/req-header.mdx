# Request headers

Request headers are **key-value** pairs sent along with an HTTP request to provide additional information to the server about the request. The request headers give the server more information about how to process the incoming request.

**Default Headers**: Default headers are predefined headers that are part of the HTTP specification.

**Custom Headers**: Custom headers are headers that are **user-defined** and are not part of the official HTTP specification.
