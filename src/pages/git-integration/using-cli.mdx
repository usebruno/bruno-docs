# Collaboration via CLI

In the open-source version of Bruno, Git operations are performed manually using the terminal or tools like VSCode's Git features.

This includes:

- [Initializing a Git repository](#initializing-git-in-bruno-collection)
- [Adding and committing changes](#adding-and-committing-changes)
- [Pushing and pulling updates](#pushing-and-pulling-changes)

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to use Git with Bruno in the open-source version.

### Initializing Git in a Collection

To add your collection to version control, you need to initialize a Git repository in the directory where your .bru files are stored using the following steps:

1. **Navigate to the Bruno Collection Location:**

   - Navigate to the location on your PC where you created the Bruno collection, and copy the path. [^1]

2. **Change directory in Terminal:**

   - Run the following command in the terminal:

     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/bruno/collection
     ```

3. **Initialize Git:**

   - Run the following command to initialize Git in the Bruno collection directory:

     ```bash
     git init
     ```

### Adding and Committing Changes

After initializing the Git repository, you can add and commit changes to your collection.

1. **Creating a New HTTP Request in Bruno App**

   - Hover over the collection name in the Bruno app.
   - Click on the three dots, then click on "New Request."
   - Type in the name of the request and populate the URL field with `https://example.com`.
   - After populating the fields with appropriate values, click on the "Create" button, or you can press ENTER/RETURN on your keyboard to create the request. This will create a new `.bru` file with the name that you just specified.

2. **Adding and committing the changes**

   - Stage all the changes made inside the collection:

     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

   - Commit the changes:

     ```bash
     git commit -m "Created my first Bruno request üê∂"
     ```

### Pushing and Pulling Changes

To share your changes with others, you can push and pull your commits to/from a remote repository.

1. **Pushing changes**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Pulling changes**

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
