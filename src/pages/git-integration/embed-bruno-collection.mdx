# Fetch in Bruno Button

Bruno allows you to share your Git-synchronized collection via an embedded "Fetch in Bruno" (FiB) button turning the import/cloning process into a single click!

This button can be placed in websites, articles, and documentation, with support for HTML and Markdown formats.

This feature helps you to share your collections in an easy and flexible way - meeting the user wherever they are. Once imported, the user now has a Git-synced collection and can seamlessly pull down new changes as updates are made.

## Things You Need

1. Bruno installed on your system.
2. A collection that has been initialized as a Git repository [either through the UI](https://docs.usebruno.com/git-integration/using-gui/provider#initializing-git) or from [the CLI](https://docs.usebruno.com/git-integration/using-cli#initializing-git-in-bruno-collection).

## How to Share Your Collection

1. Open Bruno.
2. Either go to the collection Overview tab or click on the `...` and select `Share`.

3. Copy the generated link (HTML or Markdown).

4. Embed the link into your website, article, or documentation(e.g. GitHub Readme).

export const BrunoButton = () => (
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', width: '100%', margin: '2rem 0' }}>
    <a href="https://fetch.usebruno.com?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fusebruno%2Fgithub-rest-api-collection" 
       target="_blank" 
       rel="noopener noreferrer">
      <img 
        src="https://fetch.usebruno.com/button.svg" 
        alt="Fetch in Bruno" 
        style={{ width: '160px', height: '40px' }} 
        width="160" 
        height="40"
      />
    </a>
  </div>
);

<BrunoButton />

The Fetch in Bruno button will now automatically clone the repository and associated collection whenever it is clicked.
