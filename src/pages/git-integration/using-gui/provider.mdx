1. Launch the **Bruno app**.
2. Navigate to the collection you want to initialize with Git.
3. Click on the **Git Icon** in the top-right corner of the navbar.

## **Connecting to Remote Repository**

Once you have initialized your collection, the next step is to connect it to a remote Git repository.
You can directly connect to remote repository from Bruno using Git GUI feature.

To connect Bruno to GitHub, you need to set up either an SSH key or a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub. Follow this [official GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to set it up.

1. Create empty Git repository on your GtiHub.
2. Open **Git initialized** Bruno collection.
3. Click on **main** (top right corner).
4. Select **Remotes** from the dropdown.

After completing the above steps, your collection will be conected to GitHub. We have to **add and commit** (see below) some changes to pushed collection to GitHub.

Once your collection is connected to the remote repository, you can manage it directly from the Bruno app.

## **Adding and Committing Changes**

Once you’ve made changes to your collection in Bruno, you can easily commit those changes using the Git UI. This allows you to track changes and collaborate with your team efficiently.

Follow these steps to add and commit changes:

1. Open the collection you've initialized with Git and access the **Git UI** from the **main** dropdown in the top-right corner.
2. Go to the **Changes Tab**.
3. Click on **Add Icon** for the changes you want to commit.
4. Click on **Commit Changes** button.
5. Write a Commit Message and click **Commit**.

> You can commit all changes in a single click by pressing the **Add All Changes** button.

By following these steps, your changes are now committed and tracked in Git, ready to be pushed or shared with others.
