# Collaboration using GUI<PremiumBadge />
> GUI-based Git collaboration is available in Golden and Ultimate Editions of Bruno.

Git Integration in Bruno allows users to seamlessly connect their API collections to version-controlled Git repositories. This feature is designed to help teams collaborate more effectively by tracking changes to API collections, managing version histories, and ensuring consistency across different environments.

Initializing GIT is simpler in the Golden edition of Bruno. 
1. Click on the "initialize" button 
2. The Git modal dialogue box will appear 
3. Click on initialize option.

Once the repository is initialized, your API collection is linked to Git. You can now commit changes, push updates, and pull from the remote repository for version control and collaboration.


### Adding and Committing Changes

After making changes to your API collection, you can add and commit them to your Git repository directly from Bruno:

1. Click the **Git** button in the UI.
2. Review the changes you've made.
3. Click **Add** to stage the changes.
4. Write a commit message and click **Commit** to save your changes to the repository.

This allows you to track and document changes to your API collection with clear version histories.

### Pushing and Pulling Changes

To keep your API collection in sync with the remote Git repository, you can push and pull changes:

- **Push Changes**: After committing changes locally, click the **Push** button to upload them to the remote repository.

This ensures that your collection stays up-to-date and that team members can collaborate seamlessly.
