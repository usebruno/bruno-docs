## What is SCIM?

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is an open standard that allows for the automation of user provisioning and deprovisioning between identity providers and service providers. With SCIM, organizations can automatically manage user access to Bruno based on their identity provider configurations.

## Benefits of SCIM with Bruno

### Automated User Management
- **Automatic provisioning**: New users are automatically granted Bruno licenses when added to your identity provider
- **Automatic deprovisioning**: Users lose access to Bruno when removed from your identity provider

### Enhanced Security
- **Centralized access control**: Manage Bruno access through your existing identity management system
- **Reduced manual errors**: Eliminate manual license assignment and removal processes
- **Audit trail**: Track all provisioning and deprovisioning activities in your identity provider

### Operational Efficiency
- **Streamlined onboarding**: New employees automatically receive Bruno access as part of their standard onboarding
- **Simplified offboarding**: Departing employees automatically lose Bruno access
- **Reduced administrative overhead**: IT teams spend less time on manual license management
