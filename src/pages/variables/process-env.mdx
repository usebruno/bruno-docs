# Process Environment Variables

## Overview

Process environment variables are used to store sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and other secret values. These values are typically stored in a .env file. For more details on secret management, refer to the [secret management](/secrets-management/dotenv-file) section.

<Callout type="warning">
  You must create the `.env` file in your local project directory (e.g., using
  VS Code) to store your process environment variables. Bruno cannot create or
  manage the `.env` file for you.
</Callout>

### Creating a Process Environment Variables

To create process environment variables, you can add a .env file to the root of your Bruno collection. This file will store your secrets, which can then be accessed throughout the collection.

#### Example

In your Bruno collection, the structure might look like this:

<FileTree.Folder name="bruno-collection" defaultOpen>
  <FileTree.Folder name="api-folder">
    <FileTree.Folder name="customer-api" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="emp-api">
      <FileTree.File name="details.bru" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="lib.js" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name=".gitignore" />
  <FileTree.File name="bruno.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
  <FileTree.File name=".env" />
</FileTree.Folder>

In the `.env` file, you would store a key-value pair, like this:

```bash showLineNumbers filename=".env"
key = bruno
```

### Using the Process Environment Variables

To access the values stored in the `.env` file, you can use the `process.env` global object. For example, if you want to retrieve the key value from your `.env` file, you would use:

You can use `process.env.<secret-name>` throughout your Bruno collection to securely manage and access your environment variables.
