# Prompt Variables

## Overview

Prompt variables are **ephemeral variables** in Bruno that allow you to provide values interactively at the time a request is executed. Unlike other variable types, prompt variables do not have predefined values and are not persisted. They exist only for the duration of a single request execution.

Prompt variables are ideal for:
- Sensitive data you don't want to save in your collection
- Ad-hoc values that change frequently
- Scenarios where you want to manually provide input before sending a request

## Syntax

Prompt variables use the following syntax:

<div style={{ marginTop: '1em', marginBottom: '1em' }}>
  <PromptVar>Prompt Message</PromptVar>
</div>

- The `?` indicates this is a prompt variable
- The text after `?` is the message shown to you in the prompt dialog

Prompt variables are highlighted in blue in the Bruno UI.

## Using Prompt Variables

You can use prompt variables anywhere markup variables are supported in Bruno, including:
- URLs and query parameters
- Headers
- Request bodies
- Authentication fields

### How It Works

When you execute a request containing prompt variables, Bruno displays a modal dialog listing all prompt variables with their prompt messages. You provide values for each variable before the request is sent.

**Example:**

If your request body contains a prompt variable like <PromptVar>Prompt Var</PromptVar>:

```json
{
  "title": "{{?Prompt Var}}"
}
```

Bruno will display a prompt dialog asking for "Prompt Var" before sending the request.

### Deduplication

If you use the same prompt variable (like <PromptVar>Username</PromptVar>) multiple times in a request, Bruno will only prompt you once and substitute the value everywhere it appears.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "user": "{{?Username}}",
  "profile": {
    "name": "{{?Username}}"
  }
}
```

You will only be prompted for "Username" once, and the value will be used in both locations.

### Edge Cases

**Empty Values:**  
If you leave a prompt variable blank (without entering any value), it will be replaced with an empty string in the request.

**Canceling the Prompt:**  
If you cancel the prompt dialog, the request will not be sent.

## Behavior in Automated Environments

When running collections via **Bruno CLI** or the **Collection Runner**, any requests containing prompt variables will be **skipped** and marked as `skipped` in the output. This is because these automated environments do not support interactive prompting.

## Viewing Prompt Variables

Prompt variables are ephemeral and only exist during request execution. They are not displayed in the variables viewer and are not accessible in scripts (pre-request or post-response scripts).
