# Using Basic authentication

Basic authentication involves sending a verified username and password with your request. In the request `Auth` tab, select `Basic Auth` from the Auth Type dropdown list.

Enter your API username and password in the Username and Password fields. For extra security, store these in variables.

In the request Headers, the Authorization header passes the API a Base64 encoded string representing your username and password values, appended to the text `Basic`.
