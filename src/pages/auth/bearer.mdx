# Authenticate with a Bearer token

Bearer tokens enable requests to authenticate using an access key, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT). The token is a text string, included in the request header.
In the request `Auth` tab, select `Bearer Token` from the Auth Type dropdown list. In the Token field, enter your API key value. For added security, store it in a variable and reference the variable by name.
