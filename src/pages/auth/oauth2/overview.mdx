# Oauth 2.0 authentication in Bruno

Bruno currently supports OAuth2 authentication for the following three grant types:

- [Authorization Code](/auth/oauth2/authorization-code)
- [Client Credentials](/auth/oauth2/client-credentials)
- [Password Credentials](/auth/oauth2/password-credentials)

> Bruno handles OAuth2 differently from Postman, as it requires you to configure your own callback URL instead of providing a default one.
