# How to Use OAuth2 for the Client Credentials Grant Type

OAuth 2.0 authentication can be implemented in various ways, depending on the collection structure and specific requirements. Below are two basic examples of its usage.

## Collection level

<br />

1. Open the collection settings and navigate to the **Auth** tab.

2. Select `OAuth 2.0` as the authentication method and set the grant type to `Client Credentials`. Fill in the necessary fields with the relevant information.

3. In the **Scripts** tab, add the following script to the post-response section:

```javascript"
if(req.getAuthMode() == 'oauth2' && res.body.access_token) {
    bru.setVar('access_token_set_by_collection_script', res.body.access_token);
}
```

This script assigns the `access_token` value from the response body to a runtime variable named `access_token_set_by_collection_script`, making it available for use in all requests within the collection. You can adjust this script to suit your needs.

4. Return to the **Auth** tab and click the 'Get Access Token' button. You are now free to use the token stored in the `access_token_set_by_collection_script` runtime variable in your requests as needed.

1. Create a new empty request and navigate to the **Auth** tab.

2. Select `Oauth 2.0` as the authentication method and set the grant type to `Client Credentials`. Fill in the necessary fields with the relevant information.

3. In the **Scripts** tab, add the following script to the post-response section:

```javascript"
bru.setVar('access_token_set_by_request_script', res.body.access_token);
```

This script assigns the `access_token` value from the response body to a runtime variable named `access_token_set_by_request_script`, making it available for use in all requests within the collection. You can adjust this script to suit your needs.

4. Return to the **Auth** tab and click the 'Get Access Token' button. You are now free to use the token stored in the `access_token_set_by_request_script` runtime variable in your requests as needed.
