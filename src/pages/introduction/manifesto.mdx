# Manifesto

It's time for a revolution in API client technology!

We refuse to be shoehorned into a proprietary version control system for collaborating on API collections and we don't want the details of our APIs, API requests, or API responses synced to the cloud and potentially be made public.

We are an opensource project, rising up against the monopoly of bloated and closed systems. We believe that API collections should be co-located within your source code repository, serving as a living set of examples on how to use the API.

With Bruno, collections become first-class citizens, co-located with related information and easily version controlled. We say goodbye to bloated workspaces and global environments, and embrace the benefits of co-location.

We dream of a world where developers can clone a code repo, get it up and running, use Bruno to browse the examples on how to use the API and start playing with it. No more horror stories of _"Tim had the collections for the payment-api service, but he left the company last month."_

Join us in our mission to create a better API client for developers. Say goodbye to bloatware and hello to simplicity, efficiency and freedom. Try Bruno today and experience the difference for yourself.
