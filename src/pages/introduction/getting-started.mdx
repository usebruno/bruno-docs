# Getting Started with Bruno

### Installation Demo

No requirement for using Bruno. It installs via [download](https://www.usebruno.com/downloads), but also comes packaged for the main distributions:

- **Linux**: snap, apt
- **macOS**: Homebrew
- **Windows**: Chocolatey or Scoop

### Creating your first collection

You can create a collection by selecting `Create Collection` from the **home screen** or the **top left corner** of the app.
A popup dialog will appear, asking you to name your collection and choose its location in the file system. You can also choose to edit the generated folder's name.

### Creating your first request

Select your newly created collection from the sidebar, and click on the `···` button followed by `New Request` in the dropdown menu.

A dialog will appear, asking you choose the **type** of your request (HTTP, GraphQL, or from cURL), the **name** of your request, the **HTTP verb** and the **URL**.
