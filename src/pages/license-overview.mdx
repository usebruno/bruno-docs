# Overview

For our open-source users, there is no concept of license management! Simply download, install, and go!

Our commercial plans have different license management aspects. If you have any questions about what plan is best suited for you, please see our [pricing page <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://www.usebruno.com/pricing) or [contact us <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](mailto:sales@usebruno.com) to discuss.
