# Global Environment Variables

Global environment variables can be used across all collections and requests. Think of them as a global store accessible throughout the app.

Instead of creating the same collection variable repeatedly in each collection, you can use global variables to store common values that need to be accessed across different collections. This eliminates the repetitive task of defining the same variables every time.

## Create a Global Environment Variable

1. Go to the **Global Environments** section (top right corner) and click **Configure**.

3. (Optional) If you need to import an existing environment, you can use the **Import Environment** option.
4. Enter a name for your environment and click **Create**.

## Using Global Environment Variables

To use a global environment variable, reference it using the format `{{var_name}}` in any request or collection. These variables can be combined with other variables and used throughout your workspace, making them ideal for consistent value sharing.
