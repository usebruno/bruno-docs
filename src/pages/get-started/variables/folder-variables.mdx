# Folder Variables

Folder variables are variables that are scoped to a specific folder. They are useful for storing variables that are used across multiple requests in a folder.

## Creating a Folder Variable
* Go to Folder Settings (can be accessed from dropdown menu of the folder in the sidebar)
* Go to Vars Tab
* Add your variable name, value in the Pre Request Vars section
* Save your changes
