# Folder Variables

Folder variables are variables that are scoped to a specific folder. They are useful for storing variables that are used across multiple requests in a folder.

## Creating a Folder Variable

- Go to Folder Settings (can be accessed from dropdown menu of the folder in the sidebar)
- Go to Vars Tab
- Add your variable name, value in the Pre Request Vars section
- Save your changes

#### Access Folder Variable inside scripts

You can also use the `bru.getFolderVar()` function to get the value of a folder variable and use it inside your scripts.

```javascript
let bearerToken = bru.getFolderVar('bearerToken');
```
