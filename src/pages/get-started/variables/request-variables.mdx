# Request Variables

Request variables are variables that are scoped to a specific request. They are useful for storing variables that is used in a specific request.

> **Note**: With the release of v1.28.0, weâ€™ve shifted to treating all Request Variables as strings instead of inferring the data type from the value. See [discussion](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/3072) for more information.

## Creating a Request Variable

- Go to the Request
- Go to Vars Tab
- Add your variable name, value in the Pre Request Vars section
- Save your changes

#### Access Request Variable inside scripts

You can also use the `bru.getRequestVar()` function to get the value of a request variable and use it inside your scripts.

```javascript
let source = bru.getRequestVar('source');
let destination = bru.getRequestVar('destination');
```
