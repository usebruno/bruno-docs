# Environment Variables

Environment variables are variables that are scoped to an environment, such as local development or production. They are useful for storing variables that can be re-used across the collection that are different depending on the environment. An example would be the host url of the server you want to test.

## Creating an Environment Variable

- Go to environments (top right) and press configure.
- If there are no environments, you will be prompted to create one.
- Add your variable name and value for the specific environment.
- Save your changes.

## Using an Environment Variable

Just like other variables you can use the `{{varName}}` syntax to use an environment variable in a request. On the top-right, you can see which environment you are currently using and select a different one.

## Using the ./environment directory

Environment variables are synched with the `/environments` directory inside your collection. You can also create and manage environments there.

Each environment is saved in a `<environment-name>.bru` file, which looks like this:

```bash filename="local.bru"
vars {
  host: http://localhost:8787
}
```
