# Configuring Proxy Settings in Bruno

A proxy is an intermediary server that sits between a client application (like Bruno) and the destination server that the client is communicating with (like an API). The proxy server acts as a security barrier, making requests on your behalf to websites and other internet resources, and preventing others from accessing your internal network.

If your machine sits behind a corporate network or firewall, you may need to configure the proxy settings in Bruno in order for requests to be made. By default, Proxy is set to off.

Below are steps for configuring your proxy settings at different levels within Bruno.

## **1. Accessing Proxy Settings**

1. Open Bruno.
2. Click on the **Preferences** section.

## **2. Configuring Proxy Mode**

Bruno provides three options for proxy mode:

- **Off**: Disables proxy usage.
- **On**: Enables proxy and routes requests through the configured proxy.
- **System Proxy**: Uses the system-wide proxy settings.

Select **On** if you want to configure a custom proxy.

## **3. Selecting Proxy Protocol**

Bruno supports different proxy protocols. Choose one of the following:

- **HTTP**
- **HTTPS**
- **SOCKS4**
- **SOCKS5**

## **4. Entering Proxy Details**

Fill in the required fields:

- **Hostname**: The proxy server's domain or IP address (e.g., `example.com`).
- **Port**: The port number for the proxy connection (e.g., `3000`).

## **5. Enabling Authentication (Optional)**

If your proxy requires authentication:

1. Check the **Auth** checkbox.
2. Enter the **Username**.
3. Enter the **Password** (Click the eye icon to reveal the password if needed).

## **6. Configuring Proxy at Collection Level**

There may be instances in which your collection needs to use a different proxy than what you have configured globally. Configuring proxy settings at the collection level will override any configuration you've made in the preferences section.

Below are instructions on proxy settings at the collection level:

1. Open the collection settings.
2. Navigate to the **Proxy** tab.

### **Choose the Configuration Mode:**

- **Global**: Uses the main proxy settings from Preferences.
- **Enabled**: Enables a custom proxy for this collection.
- **Disabled**: Disables the proxy for this collection.

3. Choose **global, enabled, or disabled**.
4. Enter the **Hostname, Port, Protocol, Username, and Password** if needed.
5. Click **Save** to apply the settings.

## **7. Saving Proxy Configuration**

After entering the proxy details, click the **Save** button to apply the changes.

Your proxy settings are now configured in Bruno.
