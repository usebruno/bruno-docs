# Migrating from Postman

Bruno makes migrating from Postman easy. All you need to do is export your collections and environments and import them to Bruno.

## Collection Export

Open Postman and select the collection you want to migrate. Click on the `···` followed by `View more actions` to open the dropdown menu and scroll down until you find `Export`, then click on it.

<div className="flex flex-wrap items-center mt-4">

    alt="Open the collection's dropdown menu"
    width={500}
    height={200}
    className="rounded"
  />

    alt="Find the export button"
    width={200}
    height={200}
    className="ml-10 rounded"
  />
</div>

A popup dialog will appear, select either `Collection v2` or `Collection v2.1` format and click on the `Export` button.

The collection will be downloaded as a JSON file.

Now simply follow the instructions for [Importing Collections](https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/import-export-data/import-collections) and you're done!

## Export Data Dump<PremiumBadge />

<Callout type="default">Bulk Import from Postman is included in Bruno Ultimate Edition</Callout>

You can export a data dump of all your collections and environments in Postman. You can then import the data into any Bruno.

**To [export a data dump](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#export-data-dumps), do the following in Postman:**

- Select the settings icon in the header, then select `Settings`.

- Select the Data tab, then select `Request Data Export`.

- Select `Export Data`, then select the data types you want to export. You can export collections, environments, or both.

- Select `Request Data Export`.

**To import your Data Dump to Bruno:**

- Open the import menu and select `Postman Data Export`

- Select the zip file where the export was saved

- You will now see a list of all collections available for import. By default, all collections will be selected. You can chose to omit any from the import that you'd like.

- Designate a location for the collections and press `import`

> Although we have a translator for Postman scripts, it's always good practice to review the collections after import, especially if you are using deprecated Postman syntax in your scripts.

## Environment Export

Open Postman and select the environment you want to migrate. Click on the `···` to open the dropdown menu, followed by `Export` and eventually choose a location to save the environment file.

  height={200}
  className="rounded mt-4"
/>

Now open Bruno and open a collection by clicking on any request.
A button in the upper right corner will appear, click on it and select `Configure`.

  alt="Import environment button"
  width={400}
  height={200}
  className="rounded mt-4"
/>

A dialog will appear, displaying your previously exported environment file. Select the `Import` button in the bottom left corner to proceed.
Select `Postman Environment`, provide the environment file and that's it!
