# Migrating from Postman

Bruno makes migrating from Postman easy. All you need to do is export your collections and environments and import them to Bruno.

## Collection Export

Open Postman and select the collection you want to migrate. Click on the `···` followed by `View more actions` to open the dropdown menu and scroll down until you find `Export`, then click on it.

    width={200}
    height={200}
    className="ml-10 rounded"

</div>

A popup dialog will appear, select either `Collection v2` or `Collection v2.1` format and click on the `Export` button.

The collection will be downloaded as a JSON file.

Now simply follow the instructions for [Importing Collections](/get-started/import-export-data/import-collections) and you're done!

## Export Data Dump

<Callout type="default">
  Bulk Import from Postman is included in Bruno Ultimate Edition
</Callout>

You can export a data dump of all your collections and environments in Postman. You can then import the data into any Bruno.

**To [export a data dump <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#export-data-dumps), do the following in Postman:**

- Select the settings icon in the header, then select `Settings`.

- Select the Data tab, then select `Request Data Export`.

- Select `Export Data`, then select the data types you want to export. You can export collections, environments, or both.

- Select `Request Data Export`.

**To import your Data Dump to Bruno:**

- Open the import menu and select `Postman Data Export`

- Select the zip file where the export was saved

- You will now see a list of all collections available for import. By default, all collections will be selected. You can chose to omit any from the import that you'd like.

- Designate a location for the collections and press `import`

<Callout type="info">
  Although we have a translator for Postman scripts, it's always good practice to review the collections after import, especially if you are using deprecated Postman syntax in your scripts.

Environments in API clients are sets of variables that allow you to run requests against different server configurations (development, staging, production) without changing your request URLs.

3. Click on the three dots (**...**) next to the environment name
