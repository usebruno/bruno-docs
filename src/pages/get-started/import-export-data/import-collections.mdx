# Importing Collections

It's very common that users transition to Bruno from another tool, or chose to use Bruno while their colleagues may chose something else.

Whatever the case, you can import the following formats as Bruno Collections:

- Bruno Collection (if a Collection is manually shared with you)
- Postman Collection
- Postman Data Export
- Insomnia Collection
- Cloning a Git Repository
- OpenAPI V3 file
- OpenAPI V3 URL
