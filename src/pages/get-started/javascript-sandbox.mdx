# Javascript Sandbox

Your collections might include JavaScript code in Variables, Scripts, Tests, and Assertions. <br/>
We take security seriously and want to ensure you can safely interact with collections, regardless of their source or original authors. <br/>

There are two modes you can choose from:
![Javascript Sandbox](/screenshots/javascript-sandbox.png)

## Safe Mode

JavaScript code is executed in a secure sandbox and cannot access your filesystem or execute system commands. We recommend Safe Mode for most users.

> **Note**: When in doubt, leave the Collection in Safe Mode. You can always switch to Developer Mode later.

## Developer Mode

JavaScript code has access to the filesystem, can execute system commands and access sensitive information.

#### When to use Developer Mode

- You trust the collection source/authors (Ex: Collection maintained by you/your team) and Safe Mode is not enough for your use case.
- You need to use external npm packages in your scripts
- Your collection needs access to filesystem / system commands

#### When to avoid Developer Mode

- You are running a collection that you do not trust (Ex: Downloaded from the internet)

> **Warning**: Developer Mode can be dangerous and should only be used when you fully understand the implications.
