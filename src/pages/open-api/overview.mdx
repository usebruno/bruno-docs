# OpenAPI and Bruno

Bruno allows you to work with OpenAPI Specification (OAS) files in a number of ways:

- Creating a collection from an OAS file import
- Exporting a collection as an OAS file <PremiumBadge />
- Viewing and Designing an OAS file <PremiumBadge />

## Creating a Collection from OAS Import

<Callout type="info">Bruno supports importing OAS V3 files only</Callout>

- Select Import
- Choose OpenAPI V3 File

![select-openapi-file](/screenshots/open-api/select-open-api.webp)

- Select the file stored on your machine

## Exporting a Collection as an OAS File <PremiumBadge />

- Right-click on a collection and select Export

![select-export](/screenshots/open-api/select-export.webp)

- Choose OpenAPI Specification

![select-openapi-from-export-menu](/screenshots/open-api/select-open-api-menu.webp)

- Name your file and designate a location for it to be stored

![export-open-api](/screenshots/open-api/export-api-spec.webp)

## Viewing and Designing an OAS file <PremiumBadge />

If you've saved or otherwise have an OAS file on your machine, you can view the OAS in a SwaggerUI-esque manner by:

- Selecting Open API Spec

![open-open-api](/screenshots/open-api/open-api-spec.webp)

- Choose the file name and location that you want to open

This will then open the spec in a separate section of your Bruno sidebar called APIs.

If you want to create an OAS file, you can:

- Select Create API Spec
  ![create-open-api](/screenshots/open-api/create-api-spec.webp)

- Designate whether you want to create a Blank Spec, or generate it from an existing Bruno Collection

![location-open-api](/screenshots/open-api/select-api-spec-location.webp)

- Choose a name and location for the spec to be saved under.

You will now have the scaffolding of an OAS that you can continue to design.
