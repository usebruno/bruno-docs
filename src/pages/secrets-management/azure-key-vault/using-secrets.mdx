Secrets are accessed in the same way as collection and environment variables. The secrets can be accessed in headers, query, body, auth input fields similar to collection and environment variables.

<br />

Secrets need to be prefixed with `$secrets` followed by the `name` and then the `key name`, all separated by periods.

<br />

Pattern: `$secrets`.`<name>`.`<key-name>`.

Example:
If you have a secret named `dbCredentials` with a key `username`, you can reference it as:
`$secrets.dbCredentials.username`
