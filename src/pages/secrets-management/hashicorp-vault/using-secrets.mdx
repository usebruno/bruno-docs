Secrets are accessed in the same way as collection and environment variables. The secrets can be accessed in headers, query, body, auth input fields similar to collection and environment variables.

<br />

Secrets need to be prefixed with `$secrets` followed by the `secret name` and then the `key name`, all seperated by periods.

<br />

Pattern: `$secrets`.`<secret-name>`.`<key-name>`.
