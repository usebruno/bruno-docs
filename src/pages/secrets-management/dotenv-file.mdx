# Secrets Management

## DotEnv File

Environment variables are used to store sensitive data such as API keys, tokens, and configuration settings outside the source code. This helps keep your code secure and makes it easier to manage different settings for various environments (e.g., local, staging, production).
In **Bruno**, environment variables can be managed through `.env` files.

## DotEnv File for Secret Management

In **Bruno**, you can store your secrets (e.g., API keys, JWT tokens) in a `.env` file located at the **root** of your collection folder. This approach is inspired by how developers typically manage secrets in their codebase.

You **cannot** create the `.env` file directly inside Bruno. You need to manually create the `.env` file at the **root** of your Bruno collection folder to store your secrets. Once created, you can access those variables within your Bruno collection.

### Folder Structure Example

Below is an example folder structure for your collection:

<FileTree.Folder name="bruno-collection" defaultOpen>
  <FileTree.Folder name="api-folder">
    <FileTree.Folder name="customer-api" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="emp-api">
      <FileTree.File name="details.bru" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="lib.js" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name=".env" />
  <FileTree.File name=".gitignore" />
  <FileTree.File name="bruno.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
</FileTree.Folder>

## Creating and Using the `.env` File

1. Create a `.env` file manually in the root of your collection folder. This file will store your sensitive environment variables.

2. Define your secrets in the `.env` file. For example:

```bash filename=".env" showLineNumbers
JWT_TOKEN=your_jwt_token_value
API_KEY=your_api_key_value
```

These secrets will be accessible in your Bruno collection via the `process.env` object.

Bruno will automatically load the secrets from this file and make them available to your collection via `process.env.<secret-name>`.

Your environment file at `environments/local.bru` would look like

```bash filename="local.bru"
vars {
  baseURL: https://echo.usebruno.com
  JWT_TOKEN: {{process.env.JWT_TOKEN}}
  API_KEY: {{process.env.API_KEY}}
}

```

In this example, the `JWT_TOKEN` secret from the `.env` file is referenced using `process.env.JWT_TOKEN`. This will be replaced with the actual value of `JWT_TOKEN` when the collection is executed.

## Managing Secrets

1. Always add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to ensure secrets are not accidentally pushed to version control.

2. If you need to share the structure of your environment variables with other developers, create a `.env.sample` file without actual secret values.
