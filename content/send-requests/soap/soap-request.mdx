# SOAP API request

Bruno enables you to make HTTP calls using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), a messaging protocol used for exchanging structured information between systems over a network. SOAP defines a standard for request-response communication and is based on XML data format.

  **Working with WSDL files?** Bruno can automatically import WSDL files and generate SOAP request collections. Learn more in the [WSDL to Bruno Converter guide](/converters/wsdl-to-bruno).

### Key Components of a SOAP Message

1. **Envelope**: The outermost element that defines the start and end of the message.
2. **Header**: (Optional) Contains meta-information or additional information about the message.
3. **Body**: The main part of the message that contains the actual data or the request/response payload

## Create SOAP request

You have two options for creating SOAP requests in Bruno:

### Option 1: Import from WSDL (Recommended)

If you have a WSDL file, Bruno can automatically generate SOAP requests with pre-configured envelopes:

1. Right-click on a collection and select **Import Collection**
2. Choose **WSDL** and upload your `.wsdl` file
3. Bruno will generate all SOAP operations with proper XML structure
