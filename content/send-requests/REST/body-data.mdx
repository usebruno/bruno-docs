# Body Data

The **Body** tab in Bruno allows you to send specific data with your API requests. You can choose from various data formats, such as Form, Raw, and others, using the dropdown menu.

## Send Body Data with API Requests

You can select the data type based on your API request requirements. For example, if you're working with a request where you need to send specific details about a particular item, you’ll likely choose JSON as the data type and include the data in the body of the request.

### Form-Data

#### 1. Multipart Form

Used for sending files along with form data, allowing multiple parts with different content types in a single request. In multipart form data, each part of the request is separated by a boundary.

1. Navigate to the **Body** tab.
2. Select **Multipart Form** from dropdown.
3. Click on **Add File** and upload your file.
4. (optional) You can also select **Add Param** for sending key-value pair data.
5. Save and execute the request.

#### 2. URL Encoded

It is commonly used for simple form submissions where data is sent as key-value pairs. Each key and value are separated by an equal sign (=), and multiple pairs are separated by an ampersand (&).

1. Navigate to the **Body** tab.
2. Select **Form URL Encoded** from dropdown.
3. Click on **Add Param** and add key-value pair.
4. Save and execute the request.

### Raw Data

Raw Data allows you to send data in its raw, unprocessed form in the body of an API request. It doesn’t require a predefined structure like key-value pairs or multi-part boundaries. Instead, you can send data exactly as it is, which is useful when dealing with structured data formats such as **JSON, XML, Sparql or plain text**.

1. Navigate to the **Body** tab.
2. In the RAW section, select your preferred data format.
3. Add appropriate data for your API request.
4. Save and execute the request.

### Other (File / Binary / No Body)

The **Other** option on the **Body** tab provides quick choices to send a file or to send no body.

1. Navigate to the **Body** tab.
2. From the dropdown, choose **Other**.
3. Two controls are available:
   - **File / Binary**: Send a file directly as the request body. Click **Select File** (or drag-and-drop) to pick the file. Bruno sends the file as-is (Content-Type will be inferred or set it in **Headers**).
   - **No Body**: Send the request with an empty body (useful for requests that require no payload).
4. (optional) Verify the **Content-Type** header if your server expects a specific media type for the uploaded file.
5. Save and execute the request.
