# Dev Tools

Bruno provides built-in Dev Tools to help you debug your APIs, catch bugs, test functionality, and get all essential details related to your API requests. The Dev Tools feature four main tabs:

1. **Console** - For testing, scripting, and debugging
2. **Network** - For analyzing network configurations and performance
3. **Performance** - For monitoring request performance metrics
4. **Terminal** - For executing git commands and terminal operations

## Network

The Network tab provides comprehensive insights into your API requests and responses. It's essential for:

- **Security Validation**: Review security headers and authentication details
- **Request/Response Inspection**: Examine headers, body, and status codes
- **Network Configuration**: Verify proxy settings and connection details
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify network-related issues and errors

This tab gives you complete visibility into the network layer of your API interactions, helping you validate response data and understand the full request lifecycle.

## Performance

The Performance tab allows you to monitor and analyze the performance metrics of your API requests. It's useful for:

- **Request Timing**: View detailed timing information for each request phase
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks and slow requests
- **Optimization**: Understand where time is being spent in your API calls
- **Benchmarking**: Compare performance across different requests and endpoints

This tab helps you optimize your API interactions and identify performance issues that may impact your application.

## Terminal

The Terminal tab provides a command-line interface within Bruno for executing git commands and terminal operations. It's useful for:

- **Git Operations**: Execute git commands directly from Bruno (e.g., git checkout, git branch)
- **Version Control**: Manage your API collection's version control without leaving Bruno
- **Workflow Integration**: Streamline your development workflow by combining API testing with git operations
- **Session Management**: View and manage multiple terminal sessions

This tab integrates git functionality directly into your development environment, making it easier to manage collections that are version-controlled.
