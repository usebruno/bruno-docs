# Response Data and Cookies

When an API request is executed, the server returns response data. Bruno helps you inspect, debug, and troubleshoot APIs, and even allows you to download the response data as an HTML document. Additionally, you can manage and interact with the cookies associated with the API.

## Response Data

Once the request is executed, Bruno displays the response data from the API. You can view the following in the response panel:

- Request and response headers in the timeline
- Response body
- Test results

You can also:

- Save response as an example for documentation
- Clear the response data
- View the request status code
- View the API response in both web and raw formats
- Export response data to file

## Cookies

Bruno shows the cookies associated with each request. Cookies are typically used for storing user sessions and personalized content.

## Debugging

Bruno includes a Chrome Console and DevTools, which are valuable tools for inspecting requests and troubleshooting issues. Some useful features in DevTools include:

- JSON to YAML conversion
- JWT decoding
- Other features to help you work through complex issues when dealing with APIs
