# Sending Requests and Handling Responses in Bruno

Whether you're developing your own API or testing a third-party one, you can use Bruno as an **API Testing Client** to send requests and receive responses. With Bruno, you can create, update, delete, and send data with custom parameters and authorization details.

When you send a request and receive a response through Bruno, the interface displays the information clearly, allowing you to debug errors, handle responses, and resolve any issues efficiently.

In the above example we are sending `Post` request to Bruno echo server with json body. The echo server will respond with same data we sent in a request as a output.
