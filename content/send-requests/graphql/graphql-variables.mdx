# GraphQL Variables

Variables in GraphQL allow you to create dynamic, reusable, and secure queries. Instead of embedding values directly in your query string, you can use variables to pass values separately. This approach offers several benefits:

- **Security**: Prevents GraphQL injection attacks
- **Reusability**: Same query can be used with different values
- **Type Safety**: Variables are strongly typed
- **Readability**: Makes queries cleaner and easier to understand

## Adding Variables to Your GraphQL Request

1. **Create a GraphQL Request**:
   - Open Bruno and create a new GraphQL request
   - Select the appropriate HTTP method (usually POST)

2. **Define Variables**:
   - Go to the `Variables` section
   - Add your variables in JSON format
   - Each variable should match the type defined in your query

3. **Write Your Query with Variables**:
   - Use the `$` prefix to declare variables
   - Reference variables in your query using the `$variableName` syntax

**Example Query with Variables:**

You can test this query using the Countries GraphQL API: `https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql`

```graphql
query CountryQuery($code: ID!) {
  country(code: $code) {
    name
    native
    capital
    emoji
    currency
    languages {
      code
      name
    }
  }
}
```

**Variables (JSON format):**

```json
{
  "code": "BR"
}
```

In this example, the `$code` variable is defined as a required ID type (`ID!`), and its value `"BR"` is passed separately in the Variables section.

4. **Execute the Request**:
   - Bruno will automatically combine your query and variables
   - The variables will be properly escaped and sent with the request
