# JavaScript Sandbox

Bruno provides two modes for executing JavaScript code in your collections: 
1. Safe Mode
2. Developer Mode

![Javascript Sandbox](/screenshots/javascript-sandbox.webp)

<Callout type="info">
  **Bruno CLI v3.0.0 Update**: When using Bruno CLI, the default mode is now **Safe Mode**. To use Developer Mode features in CLI, you must pass the `--sandbox=developer` flag. Learn more in the [Bruno CLI documentation](/bru-cli/runCollection#running-with-developer-mode).
</Callout>

## Safe Mode

JavaScript code is executed in a secure sandbox and cannot access your filesystem or execute system commands. We recommend Safe Mode for most users.

<Callout type="info">
  When in doubt, leave the Collection in Safe Mode. You can always switch to Developer Mode later.
</Callout>

## Developer Mode

JavaScript code has access to the filesystem, can execute system commands and access sensitive information.

#### When to use Developer Mode

- You trust the collection source/authors (Ex: Collection maintained by you/your team) and Safe Mode is not enough for your use case.
- You need to use external npm packages in your scripts
- Your collection needs access to filesystem / system commands

#### When to avoid Developer Mode

- You are running a collection that you do not trust (Ex: Downloaded from the internet)

<Callout type="warning">
  Developer Mode can be dangerous and should only be used when you fully understand the implications.
</Callout>
