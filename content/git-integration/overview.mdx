# Collaboration in Bruno

Bruno's superpower is the ability to collaborate natively using version control systems like [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), etc, and platforms like GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc. This gives you and your teammates confidence that a collection is current, and provides benefits of co-location if you choose to store collections directly alongside your source code.

The process of collaborating on a Bruno collection is more or less the same in all of the above-mentioned platforms. For beginners, you can take a look at this tutorial on version control [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

There are two ways to collaborate via native Git in Bruno:

1. Using the terminal or command line to execute Git commands
2. Using Bruno's GUI-based Git functionality

<Callout type="info">
  **Bruno 3.0.0+**: Core Git UI features (init, view diffs, check for updates, pull, clone) are now available in the free version. Advanced features like commit, push, branching, and merge conflict resolution require Pro or Ultimate editions.

These approaches are documented separately for ease of access. So let's dive into the next section.
