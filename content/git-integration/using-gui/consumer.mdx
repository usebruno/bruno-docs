## Cloning Collections from GitHub

To clone a collection from GitHub into **Bruno**, you need to have an existing collection repository hosted on GitHub.

For example, you can use this [Bruno repository](https://github.com/usebruno/github-rest-api-collection) and follow the steps below.

1. Launch **Bruno** and click the **Import Collection** button in the Quick Actions section on the Overview page. Alternatively, click the **+** icon in the sidebar and select **Import collection**.

3. Enter the **Git repository URL** and click the **Clone** button.

Your collection will now be open in **Bruno**.

## Checking for Updates

You can check if there are new changes available in the remote repository.

1. Go to **Git UI**.
2. Click the **Fetch** button.
3. Bruno will display if there are incoming changes available.

This allows you to see if your team has pushed new changes before you pull them.

## Pulling Changes

Pull the latest changes from the remote repository to stay synchronized with your team.

1. Go to **Git UI**.
2. Click the **Fetch** button.
3. Click the **Pull** button.

Now you can see all your remote changes pulled in your collection.

<Callout type="info">
  If you have local uncommitted changes when pulling, you may be prompted to stash them first. The [Stash Changes](/git-integration/using-gui/provider#stash-changes) feature (Pro/Ultimate) helps manage this workflow.
