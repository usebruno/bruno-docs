# How to Use OAuth2 for the Authorization Code Grant Type

OAuth2 can be configured in multiple ways, making it adaptable to your needs. You can configure OAuth2 auth at collection, folder, and request level.

## OAuth2 Configuration

Select `OAuth 2.0` as the auth method and set the grant type to `Authorization Code`. Fill in the following fields:

- **Callback URL**: Also known as **Redirect URI**, this URL must be configured with the IdP*
- **Authorization URL**: The IdP's authorization endpoint, often named **/auth** or **/authorization**
- **Access Token URL**: The IdP's token endpoint, often named **/token**
- **Client ID**: Also known as **App ID**, the IdP-supplied client identifier
- **Client Secret**: Also known as **App Secret**, the IdP-supplied client secret
- **Scope**: The requested scope(s) for the access
- **State**: Can be a random value or transfer data
- **Add Credentials to**: Choose how to add the access token to requests (in the Request Body or a Basic Auth Header)

*For Bruno's purposes, this can be any URL because the redirect will be intercepted before getting there (see [Understanding Callback URLs](#understanding-callback-urls-redirect-uris)). However, it still must match a **Callback URL** (or **Redirect URI**) configured with the IdP. 

*The IdP (Identity Provider) is the OAuth2 authorization provider (like Azure, Google, Facebook, etc.) managing access to the API.

### Use PKCE 

Enable "Use PKCE" if your OAuth provider supports it as a recommended best security practice and because Bruno will take care of it for you!

## Understanding Callback URLs (Redirect URIs)

The **Callback URL** (also known as **Redirect URI**) is a critical component of the OAuth2 authorization code flow. Here's what you need to know for Bruno:

### How Bruno Handles Callback URLs

Bruno does not actually redirect to the Callback URL. Instead, Bruno effectively serves as the redirect endpoint by intercepting the redirect attempt from the OAuth2 IdP (Identity Provider). That's how Bruno is able to handle the authorization code exchange and receive the access token.

This means:
- **Bruno Support all formats**: It can handle any callback URL format that your OAuth2 provider allows
- **Callback URL isn't actually hit**: Bruno never actually navigates to the Callback URL
- **Security maintained**: The auth process is handled securely

<Callout type="warning">
If your application is already configured with OAuth2, use one of the existing callback URLs from your OAuth2 provider console. Do not add new URLs unless necessary.

## Token Configuration and Usage

Before getting the access token, configure how you want to use it in your requests:

1. **Token Usage Configuration**:
   - **Add token to**: Specify how the token should be included in requests:
     - **Headers**: Adds the token to request headers with a configurable prefix (default: `"Bearer"`).
     - **URL**: Adds the token as a URL query parameter with a configurable parameter name (default: `"access_token"`).

2. **Token Management Settings**:
   - **Auto-fetch**: When enabled, Bruno will automatically fetch a new token when you try to access a resource and don't have a valid token.
   - **Auto-refresh**: When enabled, Bruno will automatically refresh your token using the refresh URL when it expires.

   These settings streamline your workflow by reducing manual token management. Note that token refresh operations require a valid refresh token to be available.

<Callout type="important">
  You may optionally assign a Token ID to your token. If you do, you can reference this token in requests using the format `{{$oauth2.<tokenId>.access_token}}` (replace `<tokenId>` with your Token ID).
</Callout>

<Callout>
If you use the same Token ID in multiple OAuth requests, Bruno will overwrite the existing token data. Make sure to use unique Token IDs for different OAuth configurations.

2. Click **Get Access Token** to obtain and store the token.
