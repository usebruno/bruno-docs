# Authenticate using AWS Signature 

AWS Signature is the authorization workflow for Amazon Web Services requests. AWS uses a custom HTTP scheme based on a keyed-HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code) for authentication.

The official AWS Signature documentation provides more detail:

- [Signing and Authenticating Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html)

- [How to call an API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-call-api.html) 

To use AWS Signature, do the following:

1. In the `Auth` tab for a request, select `AWS Sig V4` from  dropdown list.

2. Enter your *AccessKeyID* and *SecretKey* values.

  For extra security, integrate Bruno with your secret manager to store these values in a single location. Learn more [here](../secrets-management/hashicorp-vault/overview).
</Callout>

The AWS Signature parameters are as follows:

- Session Token - Required only when using temporary security credentials.
- Service Name - The service receiving the request.
- AWS Region - The region receiving the request.
- Profile Name - name of your AWS signing profile
