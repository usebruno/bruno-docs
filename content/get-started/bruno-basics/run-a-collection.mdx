# Run a Collection

Bruno's Collection Runner allows you to execute multiple requests in sequence, making it easy to test APIs, automate workflows, and run data-driven tests.

## Running a Collection

There are two ways to open the Collection Runner:

**Option 1:** Click the `...` button next to your collection in the sidebar, then select **Run**

## Collection Runner Options

Once the Collection Runner is open, you can configure your collection run:

### Basic Settings

- **Delay between requests** - Add a pause (in milliseconds) between each request execution
- **Configure requests to run** - Select specific requests, reorder execution, or skip certain requests

### Filtering Requests by Tags

You can filter which requests to run using tags. This is useful for running specific test suites like smoke tests, sanity tests, or regression tests.

### Data-Driven Testing

Run your collection multiple times with different data sets using CSV or JSON files. This feature is perfect for testing with multiple users, datasets, or scenarios.

**How it works:**
1. Enable **Run with Parameters**
2. Select file type: **CSV** or **JSON**
3. Upload your data file
4. Bruno will execute the collection once for each row/entry in your file

Variables from your data file can be accessed using `{{variableName}}` syntax in requests.

## Automating Collection Runs

Bruno CLI allows you to run collections from the command line, making it easy to integrate with CI/CD pipelines and automated testing workflows.
