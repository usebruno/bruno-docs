# Creating a Collection

A collection in Bruno is a structured group of API requests, tests, and related resources that helps you organize and manage your API testing workflow.

<Callout type="info">
  If you have an existing collection inside of another tool that you would like to import, please see [Importing Collections <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/import-export-data/import-collections).
</Callout>

## How to Create a Collection

1. Open Bruno and navigate to the **home screen**
2. Click on the `···` button and select `Create Collection` from dropdown.

5. Click **Create**

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first collection.

## Custom Collection Names

<Callout type="info">
  Starting with [Bruno v1.40.0 <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://www.usebruno.com/downloads), you can
  now use special characters in collection names and customize how they appear in
  the filesystem.
</Callout>

You can use any characters in your collection names, including special characters like `/`, `[`, `]`, `*`, etc. Bruno automatically handles filesystem compatibility by replacing unsupported characters with `-` in the filenames while preserving your original collection name.

[Add a request <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/bruno-basics/create-a-request) to your collection as a next step!
