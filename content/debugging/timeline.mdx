# Timeline

The **Timeline** tab provides comprehensive insights into your API requests and responses. It displays detailed information about what was sent, what was received, and network-level details to help you debug and validate your API calls effectively.

## Timeline Structure

The Timeline tab is organized into three categories:

1. **Request**
2. **Response**
3. **Network Logs**
