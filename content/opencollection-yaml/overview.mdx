# OpenCollection YAML Format

<Callout type="info">
  YAML support is available starting with Bruno 3.0.0. Bruno continues to support `.bru` files alongside the new YAML format.
</Callout>

Starting with Bruno 3.0.0, you can save your API request data using YAML (`.yml`) files as an alternative to the `.bru` format. This YAML format follows the [OpenCollection specification](https://spec.opencollection.com/), an **open specification created by Bruno** for defining executable API collections.

## Why OpenCollection YAML?

OpenCollection combines the power of an open specification with the industry-standard YAML format:

### Open Specification

- **Community-driven standard** — OpenCollection is an open specification created by Bruno, designed to be transparent and extensible
- **No vendor lock-in** — Your API collections are stored in a well-documented, open format that you fully own and control
- **Interoperability** — Build tooling, integrations, and workflows around a documented specification

### Industry-Standard YAML Format

- **Universal format** — YAML is one of the most widely adopted data serialization formats, used across the software industry
- **Zero learning curve** — If you've worked with Kubernetes, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, or countless other tools, you already know YAML
- **Human-readable** — Clean, intuitive syntax that's easy to read, write, and review in pull requests

### Seamless Tooling Integration

Since everything is stored in standard YAML, you can leverage the entire ecosystem of existing tools:

- **IDE support** — Native syntax highlighting in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, Vim, and virtually any editor without additional extensions
- **Linting & validation** — Use tools like `yamllint`, `prettier`, or custom JSON Schema validators
- **Git integration** — GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide built-in YAML syntax highlighting and diff views for pull requests
- **Scripting & automation** — Parse and manipulate collections with standard YAML libraries in any programming language (Python, Node.js, Go, etc.)
- **CI/CD pipelines** — Easily integrate with existing pipeline tools that already understand YAML

## OpenCollection vs OpenAPI

OpenCollection and OpenAPI serve complementary purposes:

| OpenAPI | OpenCollection |
|---------|----------------|
| Defines **what** your API is — the contract, schema, and structure | Defines **how** to use your API — scenarios, workflows, and execution |
| API endpoints and HTTP methods | Business workflows and sequences |
| Request and response schemas | Pre-request scripts and tests |
| Authentication requirements | Environment variables and secrets |
| Data types and validation rules | Runnable, shareable collections |

**OpenAPI tells you the shape of the door. OpenCollection shows you how to walk through it.**

## Quick Example

Here's what a simple POST request looks like in YAML format:

```yaml
meta:
  name: Create User
  seq: 1

http:
  method: post
  url: https://api.example.com/users
  headers:
    - name: Content-Type
      value: application/json
  body:
    type: json
    data: |-
      {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com"
      }

tests: |-
  expect(res.status).to.equal(201);
```

Compare this to the equivalent `.bru` file:

```bash
meta {
  name: Create User
  seq: 1
}

post {
  url: https://api.example.com/users
}

headers {
  Content-Type: application/json
}

body:json {
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
}

tests {
  expect(res.status).to.equal(201);
}
```

## File Storage

When using YAML format, your collections will be stored with `.yml` file extensions instead of `.bru`. The folder structure remains the same:

```
my-collection/
├── bruno.json           # Collection configuration
├── environments/
│   └── development.yml
├── users/
│   ├── create-user.yml
│   ├── get-user.yml
│   └── delete-user.yml
└── orders/
    └── create-order.yml
```

## Migration

Bruno supports both `.bru` and `.yml` formats, so you can migrate your collections gradually. Both formats can coexist within the same collection during the transition period.

<Callout type="warning">
  Migration tooling is planned for a future release. For now, you can manually convert files or create new requests using the YAML format.
