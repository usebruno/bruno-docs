Collection variables are variables that are scoped to a specific collection. They are useful for storing variables that are used across multiple requests in a collection.

## Creating a Collection Variable

You can also use the `bru.getCollectionVar()` function to get the value of a runtime variable and use it inside your pre request scripts.

```javascript
let namespace = bru.getCollectionVar("namespace");
```
