# Global Environment Variables

<Callout type="info">

Global variables are stored in the application's memory. You can access them by visiting the About section from Preferences and navigating to the AppData path location.

</Callout>

Global environment variables can be used across all collections and requests. Think of them as a global store accessible throughout the app.

Instead of creating the same collection variable repeatedly in each collection, you can use global variables to store common values that need to be accessed across different collections. This eliminates the repetitive task of defining the same variables every time.

## Create a Global Environment Variable

1. Go to the **Environments** section (top right corner).
2. Navigate to the **Global** tab and click on **Create**.

3. (Optional) If you need to import an existing environment, you can use the **Import Environment** option.
4. Enter a name for your environment and click **Create**.

6. Click **Save**.

Your global environment variable is now created and can be accessed across your workspace.

## Using Global Environment Variables

To use a global environment variable, reference it using the format `{{var_name}}` in any request or collection. These variables can be combined with other variables and used throughout your workspace, making them ideal for consistent value sharing.
