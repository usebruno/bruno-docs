# Global Environment Variables

<Callout type="info">

Global variables are stored in the application's memory. You can access them by visiting the About section from Preferences and navigating to the AppData path location.

</Callout>

Global environment variables can be used across all collections and requests. Think of them as a global store accessible throughout the app.

Instead of creating the same collection variable repeatedly in each collection, you can use global variables to store common values that need to be accessed across different collections. This eliminates the repetitive task of defining the same variables every time.

## Create a Global Environment Variable

1. Go to the **Environments** section (top right corner).

2. Navigate to the **Global** tab and click on **Create**.
3. (Optional) If you need to import an existing environment, you can use the **Import Environment** option.

6. Click **Save**.

Your global environment variable is now created and can be accessed across your workspace.

## Using Global Environment Variables

To use a global environment variable, reference it using the format `{{var_name}}` in any request or collection. These variables can be combined with other variables and used throughout your workspace, making them ideal for consistent value sharing.

### Importing Environment Variables

The import feature accepts environment files in both **Bruno** and **Postman** formats:

1. Click on the **Import** button.
2. Select the environment file you want to import
3. The variables will be added to your global environment.

### Exporting Environment Variables

1. Click on the **Export** button.
2. If you have multiple environments, select which environments you want to export.
3. Choose the location where you want to save the exported JSON file.

4. The environment variables will be saved as a JSON file that can be shared or backed up.

  Secret variables (variables marked as secret) will not be included in the exported JSON file for security reasons.
