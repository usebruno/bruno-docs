# APIs Documentation

Bruno allows you to create API documentation at four distinct levels: **Workspace, Collection, Folder, and Request**.

With full Markdown support you can write clear, concise, and well-structured documentation at each level supplemented with any relevant screenshots, gifs, or other elements to ensure your users have a seamless onboarding experience.

Although Collections are the machine-readable instructions for interacting with an API, offering human-readable instructions to your users can significantly reduce the time to their first interaction.

1. [Document a workspace](./workspace-docs.mdx)
2. [Document a collection](./collection-docs.mdx)
3. [Document a folder](./folder-docs.mdx)
4. [Document a request](./request-docs.mdx)
