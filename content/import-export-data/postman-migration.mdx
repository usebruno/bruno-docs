Bruno makes migrating from Postman easy. All you need to do is export your collections and environments and import them to Bruno.

## Collection Export

</div>

A popup dialog will appear, select either `Collection v2` or `Collection v2.1` format and click on the `Export` button.

## Export Data Dump

<Callout type="default">
  Bulk Import from Postman is included in Bruno Ultimate Edition
</Callout>

You can export a data dump of all your collections and environments in Postman. You can then import the data into any Bruno.

**To [export a data dump <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#export-data-dumps), do the following in Postman:**

- Click your avatar in the Postman header, then click Settings.

- Click the Account tab, then Export Data.

- Click Export Data, then select the data types you want to export. You can export collections, environments, or both.

- Click Request Data Export.

<Callout type="info">
  When the export is ready, you'll get an email with a link to download the bulk data file. The download is available for two days, after which it expires.
</Callout>

**To import your Data Dump to Bruno:**

- Open the import menu and select `Postman Data Export`

- Select the zip file where the export was saved

- You will now see a list of all collections available for import. By default, all collections will be selected. You can chose to omit any from the import that you'd like.

- Designate a location for the collections and press `import`

<Callout type="info">
  Although we have a translator for Postman scripts, it's always good practice to review the collections after import, especially if you are using deprecated Postman syntax in your scripts.
</Callout>

3. Click on the three dots (**...**) next to the environment name
